# Big Five emotional range
{: #emotionalRange}

*Emotional range*, also referred to as *Neuroticism* or *Natural reactions*, is the extent to which a person's emotions are sensitive to the individual's environment.  The tables that follow qualify results for characteristics as *high* or *low*:
{: shortdesc}

-   Any score above the mean of 0.5 indicates a greater than average tendency for a characteristic. A score at or above 0.75 indicates readily discernible aspects of the characteristic; such scores are considered *high*.
-   The opposite statements are true of scores below 0.50 and 0.25, which are considered *low*.

## Facets
{: #facets-emote}

Brief descriptions of the dimension's facets and of individuals who score high in each facet.

| Facet | Individuals who score high... |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **Anger / Fiery** | Have a tendency to feel angry. |
| **Anxiety / Prone to worry** | Often feel like something unpleasant, threatening, or dangerous is about to happen. The "fight-or-flight" system of their brains is too easily and too often engaged. |
| **Depression / Melancholy / Moodiness** | Tend to react more readily to life's ups and downs. |
| **Immoderation / Self-indulgence** | Feel strong cravings and urges that they have difficulty resisting, even though they know that they are likely to regret them later. They tend to be oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long-term consequences. |
| **Self-consciousness** | Are sensitive about what others think of them. Their concerns about rejection and ridicule cause them to feel shy and uncomfortable around others; they are easily embarrassed. |
| **Vulnerability / Susceptible to stress / Sensitivity to stress** | Have difficulty coping with stress. They experience panic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or when facing emergency situations. |
