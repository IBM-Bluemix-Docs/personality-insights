*Agreeableness* is a person's tendency to be compassionate and cooperative toward others. The tables that follow qualify results for characteristics as *high* or *low*:
{: shortdesc}

-   Any score above the mean of 0.5 indicates a greater than average tendency for a characteristic. A score at or above 0.75 indicates readily discernible aspects of the characteristic; such scores are considered *high*.
-   The opposite statements are true of scores below 0.50 and 0.25, which are considered *low*.

## Facets
{: #facets-agree}

Brief descriptions of the dimension's facets and of individuals who score high in each facet.

| Facet | Individuals who score high... |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **Altruism / Altruistic** | Find that helping others is genuinely rewarding, that doing things for others is a form of self-fulfillment rather than self-sacrifice. |
| **Cooperation / Accommodating / Compliance** | Dislike confrontation. They are perfectly willing to compromise or to deny their own needs to get along with others. |
| **Modesty / Modest** | Are unassuming, rather self-effacing, and humble. However, they do not necessarily lack self-confidence or self-esteem. |
| **Morality / Uncompromising / Sincerity** | See no need for pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore candid, frank, and genuine. |
| **Sympathy / Empathetic** | Are tender-hearted and compassionate. |
| **Trust / Trusting of others** | Assume that most people are fundamentally fair, honest, and have good intentions. They take people at face value and are willing to forgive and forget. |
