# Big Five agreeableness
{: #agreeableness}

*Agreeableness* is a person's tendency to be compassionate and cooperative toward others. The tables that follow qualify results for characteristics as *high* or *low*:
{: shortdesc}

-   Any score above the mean of 0.5 indicates a greater than average tendency for a characteristic. A score at or above 0.75 indicates readily discernible aspects of the characteristic; such scores are considered *high*.
-   The opposite statements are true of scores below 0.50 and 0.25, which are considered *low*.
